// changing Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
//• Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
//• Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
//• Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

// let  guestArr : string[] = ["Amna", "Faryal", "Faisal", "Shafak"]

// let canNotAttend : string = "Faryal"
// console.log(canNotAttend + " " + "can not make it, for dinner")

// let newGuest : string = "Sufiyan"
// guestArr[guestArr.indexOf(canNotAttend)] = newGuest;
// console.log(guestArr)

// guestArr.map((item) => 
//         console.log(`Dear ${item}, Are You Cordinally Invited To A Dinner`)
// );
